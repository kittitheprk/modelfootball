**PRE-MATCH STATUS: CONFIRMED LINEUPS**
**Liverpool vs Manchester City (Anfield)**
*   **Kickoff:** 23:30 Today
*   **Standings:** Man City 2nd (47 pts, form: DDLWD), Liverpool 6th (39 pts, form: DDDLW).
*   **Avg Rating Prediction:** City (6.99) slightly favored over Liverpool (6.87).

**Confirmed Lineups:**
*   **Liverpool (4-2-3-1):**
    *   **GK:** Alisson (6.82)
    *   **DEF:** Kerkez, Van Dijk (7.29 - Highest Rated LFC), Konaté, Szoboszlai (playing RB/RWB? odd position).
    *   **MID:** Mac Allister, Gravenberch (7.10).
    *   **ATT:** Gakpo, **Wirtz (New Signing?)**, Salah.
    *   **ST:** Ekitiké (6.94).
    *   *Note:* Using Szoboszlai as a RB/WB is a huge tactical gamble or misunderstanding of the graphic (he is listed as #8 alongside defenders). Let's assume Alexander-Arnold is out. Wirtz is starting!

*   **Man City (4-3-3):**
    *   **GK:** Donnarumma (7.01).
    *   **DEF:** Nouri, Guehi, Khusanov, Nunes (Inverted FB?).
    *   **MID:** Bernardo Silva, Rodri (7.35 - Highest Rated City), O'Reilly.
    *   **ATT:** Semenyo, **Haaland (7.42 - Machine)**, Marmoush.
    *   *Note:* City's defense looks very rotated (Nouri, Khusanov, Guehi). Marmoush and Semenyo starting on wings.

**Key Observations:**
*   **Liverpool's Defense:** Szoboszlai at Right Back? This is a target for City's left winger (Marmoush).
*   **City's Defence:** Very new look back line (Khusanov/Guehi pairing). Can Solah exploit this?
*   **Midfield:** Rodri vs Mac Allister/Gravenberch will decide the game.
